# lib-ui-apple

## NOTE: This is still in pre-release state and can contain breaking changes.

Contains common UI components, theming and extensions for my Apple platform apps.

## Disclaimer

This project is open source and open to anyone to use as they see fit.
But I am building this with myself as the main target audience, so this will not be published anywhere.
